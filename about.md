![Seamus, Jedi Knight](/img/cats/seamus_jedi.jpg){: .book .img-circle} Hello, I'm Bart Lantz, I'm a programmer/geek living in Denvercityville, Colorado. I live here with my accordionist partner and our two cats. I ride bike everywhere. Colorado is great for that: you can commute by bike 11 months out of the year! I enjoy creating free open source software. I run Ubuntu Linux on my personal computers. My editors of choice are Emacs and Vim, yes, both!
